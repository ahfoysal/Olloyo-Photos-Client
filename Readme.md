## Features

### Image Gallery

- **Uploading Photos:** Users can easily upload photos to add to their gallery. Simply click the "Upload" button and select the images you want to include.

- **Sorting:** We have implemented a powerful reordering functionality that empowers users to rearrange the order of images in the gallery. This is achieved through intuitive drag-and-drop capabilities, providing an exceptional user experience.

- **Deleting Multiple Images:** Olloyo Photos allows users to select and delete multiple images from their gallery. The selected images are visually highlighted for clarity and ease of use.

- **Setting Feature Image:** The first image, starting from the left-to-right direction, is designated as the featured image, and it is visually distinct from the other images.

- **User Experience:** The platform is designed for a smooth and responsive user experience. Transitions and animations have been implemented to ensure a polished and engaging look and feel.
